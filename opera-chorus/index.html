      Shortly after the creation of the Foothills Philharmonic Chorus in 2014,
      the Foothills Philharmonic Opera Chorus was born, following a conversation
      between Tim Korthuis, and Uwe Dambrüch, one of the principal soloists of
      the
      <a href="http://www.calgaryconcertopera.com/" target="_blank"
        >Calgary Concert Opera Company</a
      >. Shortly thereafter, the Society was contacted by Chris Gieck and Barb
      King, founders of the Calgary Concert Opera Company, to partner together
      for the performance of “La Gioconda” in the Spring of 2014.

      The performance was a resounding success, and since then, the Calgary
      Concert Opera Company and the Opera Chorus have partnered in several more
      events, including a concert of opera favourites from “Carmen”, “Nabucco”
      and more, and a performance with the
      <a href="https://www.rockymountainsymphony.ca/" target="_blank"
        >Rocky Mountain Symphony Orchestra</a
      >
      in January of 2017.

      Interest in the Opera Chorus has continued to grow, to the point of
      becoming a separate ensemble within the Society. We are excited to see
      what the future holds for the Opera Chorus.
