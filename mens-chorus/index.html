      The Foothills Philharmonic Men’s Chorus (originally the Okotoks Men's
      Chorus) was founded in 2005 as a small group of men who just loved to
      sing! The were brought together through the inspiration and efforts of
      Phillip Pack (director 2005-2007), saw many great seasons with Tim
      Korthuis (2007-2020), and is currently directed by Heather Haaland.

      They have grown in number and skill, performing before a variety of
      audiences both locally and provincially. They present a very diverse
      repertoire, that includes sacred, classic, folk and popular music, as well
      as performing in several languages (Italian, Latin, French, German,
      Korean, Croatian, and more). The Men’s Chorus is fortunate to have an
      enthusiastic and dedicated director in Heather Haaland. The Men’s Chorus
      regularly supports local performers by collaborating with schools, as well
      as local solo artists and artistic groups such as the Alberta Dance
      Academy.

      The Men’s Chorus loves to have fun, to laugh, to challenge themselves and
      loves to give back to their community through fundraising and the Arts.

      Foothills Philharmonic Men's Chorus!
