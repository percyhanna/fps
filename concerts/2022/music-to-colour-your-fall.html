      The Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra and Chamber Chorus open the concert
      season by teaming up this October! Featuring the works of Beethoven,
      Schumann, Whitacre, and more!
    </p>

    <p>
      The leaves are turning, the air is getting chilly, and the Foothills
      Philharmonic is back! For one night only, our Orchestra and Chamber chorus
      come together in an evening that features the works of Beethoven,
      Schumann, Whitacre, and more! Whether your autumn puts you in a romantic
      mood, as with Whitacre's "Five Hebrew Love Songs" or more meditative, like
      Beethoven's "Elegischer Gesang", we have something for everyone's fall
      mood as we bring you a night of music that will have you envisioning the
      leaves crunching underfoot and the warmth of that favourite sweater.
      Tickets available at the door or online.
