      In the summer of 2014, when the Foothills Philharmonic Society was
      created, the original vision included building an orchestra along with
      choral ensembles. We knew that there were many local instrumentalists that
      went into the city to perform in Calgary ensembles, and we wanted to build
      a place for those musicians to play in their community with their friends
      and neighbours.

    <p>
      There is still music to be performed, and great performances to be
      prepared, and we would love to have you join us as a member of the
      Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra.
