      <em>Chorus &amp; Orchestra</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Music brings the stories we tell to life! And so many of the movies we
      have loved are animated by the music of orchestras and choirs. We’ve
      picked some of the greats, and hope you’ll join us in celebrating the
      music of modern story telling! Featuring both original selections from
      films such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, and well-loved
      classical pieces from major films including Orff's “O Fortuna” and
      Mozart's “Requiem”, we invite you to experience music from timeless tales
      and bask in the stories we all love to tell and retell. Bring your family
      and your imagination, and relive some great movie moments with us!

      <em>Youth Strings</em>

    <p>
      We are very pleased to present our very first performance of our Foothills
      Youth String Orchestra, featuring an exciting blend of classical, pop and
      movie music! The beginner ensemble will kick off the concert with a
      beautiful rendition of Holst’s “Jupiter” from The Planets, a lively and
      engaging performance of “Drunken Sailor” that is sure to get the
      audience's feet tapping, as well as a wonderful energetic and gritty piece
      titled “Pirates of Aegan” and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Intermediates have diligently prepared Vivaldi’s “Concerto for Strings
      in D major, RV121” which will highlight the precision and musicianship of
      our young musicians as they perform its intricate melodies and beautiful
      harmonies. Showcasing their versatility next, they will switch gears into
      some pop music, followed by movie music including Top Gun, and Mission
      Impossible, and much more!
