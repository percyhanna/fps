      In the summer of 2014, when the Foothills Philharmonic Society was
      created, the original vision included building an orchestra along with
      choral ensembles. We knew that there were many local instrumentalists that
      went into the city to perform in Calgary ensembles, and we wanted to build
      a place for those musicians to play in their community with their friends
      and neighbours.

      After a few seasons of spreading the word, gathering musicians and
      building momentum, the Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra took form in the
      Fall of 2016 under the baton of Terry Lee. The FPO grew in numbers and
      skill, having many sold-out performances through the years. In 2024, Terry
      Lee stepped down as conductor, and after a few seasons directed by Tim
      Korthuis and Sarah McLean, Duarte Silva was invited to be the new
      conductor of the Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra.

      There is still music to be performed, and great performances to be
      prepared, and we would love to have you join us as a member of the
      Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra.
