            Ready to put those years of music training to good use again? Many
            skilled musicians are dusting off their instruments and answering
            the call to make quality music in the foothills. Do you need to be
            among us?
          </p>

          <p>
            We want to invite you to consider playing in the Foothills
            Philharmonic Orchestra, a community based, volunteer orchestra. We
            desire to bring inspiring classical music to the Foothills and
            perform music ranging from chamber music through symphonic works. We
            will be rehearsing &amp; performing in Okotoks and area.
          </p>

          <p>
            We envision 4-6 large ensemble rehearsals per performance, in
            addition to sectional work.
          </p>

          <p>
            If this sounds like an invitation with your name on it, please
            contact us soon to express your interest and receive a rehearsal
            schedule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rehearsals will begin early in 2017. We are preparing for our
            Pre-season debut performance Saturday June 10.
