    <p>
      Throughout music history, there are some texts that sound so beautiful
      when put to music, that composers have chosen to re-use them. Our concert,
      Unnatural Twins, explores the beautiful varieties of music composed for
      similar prose. From Latin works shared by Mozart and Imant Raminsh (a
      Canadian composer in the Okanagan), to the Lords Prayer in English and
      Swahili, this concert compares and contrasts beautiful texts composed in
      equally beautiful, but wildly different styles. Come join us and enjoy the
      music of these Unnatural Twins, with guests, the Calgary Korean Canadian
      Choir.

    <p>
      Join us for a pre-concert talk for an opportunity to hear some history on
      the pieces being performed, ideas that went into their creation, and
      specific things to listen for. Many creative devices are used in
      composition to help the listener understand the meaning of the words, such
      as rising pitches on words 'rising to heaven', etc. Pre-concert talk will
      be at 7:00pm on both nights.
