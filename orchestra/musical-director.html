      Since a young age I have been fascinated by music and the power it holds
      on me. It is an art form that encompasses the whole and transcends all.
      Born on a small island in the Mid-Atlantic (Azores), my ancestry consists
      of simple farmers and fishermen.

      As a young child, I sang and acted in various church and school
      performances. I had my first piano and viola lessons in my early teens,
      and completed 6 years of Conservatory in Ponta Delgada, where I switched
      to viola, my main instrument. In 1995, I commenced my post secondary
      education in Alberta and graduated with a Masters in Musicology in 2004,
      writing and presenting my thesis on the work “Flores de Musica for Organ
      1620” and the life of Manuel Rodrigues Coelho.

      I am also a Junior High teacher in Calgary. My hobbies are reading,
      hiking, travel and gardening, as well as being passionate about arranging
      and composing in my spare time. I also run and maintain my music website:
      <a href="https://partitura21edition.ca/" target="_blank"
        >partitura21edition.ca</a
      >
      which sells music from older and unknown editions and composers.
