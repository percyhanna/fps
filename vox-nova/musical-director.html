      Vox Nova was created in the Summer of 2023, under the direction of Sarah
      McLean and Tim Korthuis. Vox Nova exists to provide professional and/or
      experienced vocalists from the Foothills area the opportunity to perform
      complex repertoire to a high standard, with minimal group rehearsal
      commitment.

    <p>
      When a performance is booked, the repertoire will be handed out one month
      in advance, and musicians will be expected to learn their parts at home
      before coming together for full ensemble rehearsals a few days before the
      performance.
