            <p>The Vocal Jazz originated as an idea two members of the Chorus who wanted to explore the Vocal Jazz tradition. After a wonderfully successful trial in the Summer of 2016, their first official season started in the fall of 2016, with their first concert being December of 2016, performing to a near sold-out show!</p>

            <p>Since then, the Vocal Jazz has continued to grow, adding a Ladies Vocal Jazz due to the high interest, as well as a smaller group doing more difficult repertoire. The Vocal Jazz has since settled into a 16-member format, selected by audition, and have performed with local schools, events such as the Harvest of Hope, with the Foothills Philharmonic Chorus, and the AHSFA Vocal Ensemble.</p>

            <p>Their concerts regularly include solo acts from within the group, as well as being occasionally accompanied by a guest Jazz combo. They are excited for what the future will bring!</p>
