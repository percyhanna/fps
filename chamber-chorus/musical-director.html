      Sarah fell in love with choir by accident in high school while helping out
      backstage with a local musical theatre production. This led to her
      becoming a full-fledged choir nerd and a life of performing as a chorister
      and soloist with choirs such as the U of Alberta Madrigal Singers, Alberta
      Youth Choir, London Symphony Chorus, U of Calgary Chamber Choir, Calgary
      Philharmonic Chorus, Christ’s College Choir, and U of Cambridge Chamber
      Choir among others.

      She holds a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance and a Bachelor of
      Education in Secondary Music Education. Sarah has studied conducting with
      Graeme Langager, Hilary Apfelstadt, Caron Daley, and James Jordan. She
      graduated from the University of Cambridge with a Master of Music in
      Choral Conducting where she studied with Stephen Layton, Graham Ross,
      Daniel Hyde, and Voces8.

      Recently, Sarah revisited her roots as the Apprentice Conductor with the
      2021 Alberta Youth Choir working with Michael Zaugg. Sarah currently sings
      with Spiritus Chamber Choir, conducts the Young Singers of the Calgary
      Boys’ Choir, and teaches music in the Foothills School Division.
