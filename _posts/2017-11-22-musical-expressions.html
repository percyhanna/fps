      A number of years ago I recorded compositions I’d written for each of my
      children hoping that the recordings would connect them to their childhood
      and our family in some meaningful way, through the years to
      come. Virtually every culture of the world has given expression to the
      intangible values and experiences of that people group via music.

      In the late 1800s composer Béla Bartók, concerned that cultures would be
      lost in the urban migrations of the day, began collecting indigenous music
      of peoples in the Transylvania region of eastern Europe (now part of
      Romania). He first preserved remnants of these in a piano and violin
      composition released in 1901. In 1907 he expanded this work for orchestra.
      It is this composition that the Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra will
      perform December 15 and 16 in High River and Okotoks.

      Envision a community like ours a century or more ago, somewhat weather
      locked in the winter months, but able to come together for an evening of
      music and dance, sharing some drinks and some laughs, breaking up the
      landscape of an otherwise bleak winter’s existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, in the Foothills, our existence is neither bleak nor isolated yet
      the value in coming together on a winter’s eve to celebrate great music
      and share some encouragement together remains. December 15 and 16 will be
      such an evening. Included in the offerings will be Béla Bartók’s “Romanian
      Folk Dances”, this collection of compositions inspired by these
      Transylvanian melodies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bartok’s “Romanian Folk Dances” invite us to reflect on the uniquenesses
      and beauties of a culture that might have otherwise been inadequately
      remembered, had it not been for his years of carefully collecting these
      wonderful melodies.

          Come and be transported back to another time and another place, that’s
          not entirely different from this time and our place. I hope you’ll
          join us on one of these chilly December evenings, and celebrate with
          us!
