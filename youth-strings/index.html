      The Youth Strings is our newest ensemble that started in the spring of
      2023. This ensemble is for students aged 5 to 18, and we host two separate
      groups: a beginner group and an intermediate group. Students will learn to
      play with others, making beautiful music together, as well as participate
      in Master Classes, sectional and leadership opportunities. We will tackle
      music from a variety of genres, including traditional baroque, popular and
      movie music, as well as fiddle/folk tunes.

      The Youth Strings ensemble is directed by Madeline Bailey and Karen Dees.
