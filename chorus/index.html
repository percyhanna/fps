      The Foothills Philharmonic Chorus performs works from all periods of
      music, from Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and all the way
      through the Modern Period. We love singing works by the classic greats
      such as Mozart, Mendelssohn and Schubert, new works by Eric Whitacre and
      Arvo Part, and <a href="/repertoire">everything in between</a>.

      The Foothills Philharmonic Chorus is directed by
      <a href="/about-tim/">Tim Korthuis</a> and accompanied by
      <a href="/chorus/accompanist">Amberly Stratton</a>.
