      Is your toe tapping to your favourite tune on your iPod? There’s a high
      probability that the musicians involved in creating that music have been
      influenced by and possibly even studied as jazz musicians.<!--more-->
      There was a day when genres never mixed. But today we live in a culture of
      cross-pollination that is unprecedented in all of western history!
    </p>

    <p>
      This is true in the Foothills too! Often, the finest musicians in our
      community are highly skilled in more than one genre. Foothills
      Philharmonic Chorus conductor Tim Korthuis is not only a highly skilled
      choral conductor, but has been the piano accompanist with performing
      groups and choirs around Okotoks, and was the rock ’n roll keyboard player
      for a popular ‘originals’ band in Calgary known as “Telli”. Foothills
      Philharmonic Vocal Jazz director, Shawn Lindenbach, is the 1<sup>st</sup>
      trumpet player in the Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra, and baritone in
      the FP Chorus and Chamber Chorus.

    <p>So, with substantial “cross-over”, what makes “jazz” <em>jazz</em>?</p>

    <p>
      The roots of jazz music draw from spirituals, ragtime, Dixieland and folk.
      The broad category that emerged as jazz, included an ever widening range
      of genres… swing, bee bop, east coast and west coast. And the sponge that
      is this genre quickly embraced influences from Latin and Afro-Cuba
      cultures. There’s a poetic nicety in the generous way jazz now gives back
      to emerging music styles. Those original musicians were among the first to
      bend notes, syncopate rhythms, cross barlines and violate long standing
      rules for enunciation of lyrics and articulation of notes. There was an
      excitement and an energy to the harmonies, the power of the toe tapping
      rhythms, and there was and continues to be a strong appeal to the diverse
      styles that live under the broad umbrella of the category we call “jazz”.
      Jazz musicians “feel” and interpret and they improvise within well
      established musical boundaries.
