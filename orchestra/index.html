      The original vision of the Foothills Philharmonic Society included the
      desire to start an orchestra. The word was spread, local musicians
      registered, and excitement continued to build, until the Orchestra began
      to take form under the guidance of Terry Lee, in the Fall of 2016. In the
      fall of 2024, Sarah McLean took over as Musical Director of the Orchestra.

      The first performances of the Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra took place
      in June of 2017 at the High River and Okotoks United Churches. This
      'pre-season' featured the Orchestra performing in several orchestral
      ensembles, performing a wider variety of classic works, from Mozart to
      Vivaldi and much more, as well as featuring several local guest artists.

      The Orchestra has continued to expand and grow every season, featuring
      over 20 musicians this past season, and performing to sold-out crowds in
      Okotoks and High River. We are extremely excited for the future of the
      Orchestra, and hope you will join us as a performer or a concert
      enthusiast!
