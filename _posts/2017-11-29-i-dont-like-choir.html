      “I don’t like choir…” Well, those aren’t my words. I fell in love with
      choirs years ago, but I’m always surprised by people who state “I don’t
      like choir,” because if you like music, then I’m sorry. You probably like
      choir… you just don’t know it.

      Everyone attaches different memories to their image of “choir.” Did you
      grow up in a church? Maybe your “choir” memory is that group that sings
      Sunday mornings, but you didn’t like the music they picked. Or maybe your
      “choir” memory is Junior High, with Mrs. Musickrazy who insisted that all
      music written after 1850 was pure garbage.

      The dictionary defines choir as “an organized company of singers” or “a
      group of people who sing together.” Whether that group sings Medieval
      chants, Rock and Roll, Mozart’s greatest hits, or sings on your favourite
      Hip Hop album, that’s a choir. I’m not a sports guy, but “not liking
      choir” is akin to saying “I don’t like groups of people working together
      to score points” and allowing that to be your opinion of team sports. See?
      It just doesn’t quite make sense.

      What’s your music of choice? If it’s Rock music, Queen is one of the best
      Rock choirs, especially when they have an audience of 10,000 singing
      Bohemian Rhapsody together… or watch the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” Is Pop
      music more your style? The popularity of the movie “Pitch Perfect,” TV
      show “Glee” and the “Pentatonix” shows that choir sinks it’s teeth in
      everywhere.

          From Hip Hop to Dubstep, Country to Classical, choir is everywhere and
          in everything. Next time you hear your favourite song with a bunch of
          voices singing together, remember “Hey, I love choir!” Even better,
          come to our concerts on Dec 15 &amp; 16 to hear some great choral
          pieces and expand your musical horizons.
