      Vox Nova was created in the Summer of 2023, under the direction of Sarah
      McLean. The purpose of Vox Nova is to provide professional and/or
      experienced vocalists from the Foothills area the opportunity to perform
      complex repertoire to a high standard. This ensemble will have minimal
      rehearsal sessions; once music is handed out, musicians will be expected
      to learn their parts at home before coming together with the rest of the
      group a few days before the performance.
