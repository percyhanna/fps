          <p>Ready to put those years of music training to good use again? Many skilled musicians are dusting off their instruments and answering the call to make quality music in the foothills. Do you need to be among us?</p>

          <p>We want to invite you to consider playing in the Foothills Philharmonic Orchestra, a community based, volunteer orchestra. We desire to bring inspiring classical music to the Foothills and perform music ranging from chamber music through symphonic works. We will be rehearsing &amp; performing in Okotoks and area.</p>

          <p>We envision 4-6 large ensemble rehearsals per performance, in addition to sectional work.</p>

          <p>If this sounds like an invitation with your name on it, please contact us soon to express your interest and receive a rehearsal schedule.</p>

          <p>Rehearsals will begin early in 2017. We are preparing for our Pre-season debut performance Saturday June 10.</p>
