      Terry was raised in a musical family, and can’t recall a time when he
      wasn’t playing or singing. He began composing at age 11, received the
      school’s music award on graduation from high school, and became a voice
      major in the music program at Humber College in Toronto, where he focused
      on composition, arranging and orchestration. Music became a fundamental
      part of his career, founding a small jingle writing company, turned
      advertising agency, and then upon completion of his Masters in Theology,
      became worship pastor to 2 large Canadian churches. Over these years Terry
      has led and conducted multiple ensembles, choirs, pop horn sections, big
      bands and church orchestras. He is an accomplished singer, guitar player,
      sometimes violinist and retired trumpet player.

      He is thrilled in this next chapter to join the Foothills Philharmonic
      Society in the development of the newly forming Foothills Philharmonic
      Orchestra, as Conductor &amp; Artistic Director.
