    <p>
      Heather was raised in a musical family and church community and at a very
      young age started playing for church and working with the choirs and
      preparing concerts. This was the start of her love of accompanying and
      teaching music.
    </p>

    <p>
      For 25 plus years she has had a busy music studio teaching piano, voice
      and theory. Composing her own music resulted in her cd of 15 original
      songs in 2009. She has been accompanying and arranging music for the
      Foothills Mens Chorus since their start and for 13 years she accompanied
      and directed the Calgary Protestant Male Choir.

      She is very happy to be the Musical Director for the Foothills
      Philharmonic Vocal Jazz and Men’s Chorus!
