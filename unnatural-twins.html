          <p><strong>Exploring a variety of beautiful musical styles set to the same texts!</strong></p>

          <p>Throughout music history, there are some texts that sound so beautiful when put to music, that composers have chosen to re-use them. Our concert, Unnatural Twins, explores the beautiful varieties of music composed for similar prose. From Latin works shared by Mozart and Imant Raminsh (a Canadian composer in the Okanagan), to the Lords Prayer in English and Swahili, this concert compares and contrasts beautiful texts composed in equally beautiful, but wildly different styles.  Come join us and enjoy the music of these Unnatural Twins, with guests, the Calgary Korean Canadian Choir.</p>

          <p>Join us for a pre-concert talk for an opportunity to hear some history on the pieces being performed, ideas that went into their creation, and specific things to listen for.  Many creative devices are used in composition to help the listener understand the meaning of the words, such as rising pitches on words 'rising to heaven', etc. Pre-concert talk will be at 7:00pm on both nights.</p>
