      The Junior Singers was founded for all the young musicians in the
      Foothills region who need a place to sing! The FPJS consists of two
      groups: Prelude (ages 6-7), and Cantabile (ages 8-12). They perform a wide
      variety of music - from classical, folk, pop, gospel, show tunes, and
      more! If you're a kid who loves to sing, this is the place for you!

      The Junior Singers is led by Jeff Hibberd and accompanied by Kellee Bowie.
