    <h1>Foothills Philharmonic Junior Singers</h1>
    <h3>Registration</h3>

    <p>
      All musicians participating in one of the Foothills Philharmonic ensembles
      must first register to become a member of the Foothills Philharmonic
      Society. Once you have registered as a member of the Society, you can
      register for one or more of our musical ensembles.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Each musician must register individually as a
      Member of the Society. You will need a unique email address for each
      member. For children/youth, an adult should register on behalf of their
      child (using the child's name), but use an email address from one of the
      parents or guardians for communication purposes.
    </p>
