      Chelsea Suresh-Mills has been sharing in the joy of choral singing since
      she was 6 years old! She has been avidly involved in musical pursuits
      throughout her life, having studied solo vocal performance, performed
      extensively in community musical theatre productions, and sung in many
      auditioned choral ensembles across Canada.

      Chelsea holds a Bachelor of Arts with a specialization in vocal music from
      the University of Guelph, a Bachelor of Education from the University of
      Ottawa, and a Master of Education from Queen’s University. These days, her
      musical interests include singing with the Foothills Philharmonic Chamber
      Chorus, sharing her love of music with students as an elementary school
      teacher, and making music with her two young daughters, both of whom are
      members of Junior Singers ensembles.

      With the support of the Foothills Philharmonic Society Board, Chelsea
      co-founded the Junior Singers along with Musical Director, Jeff Hibberd in
      the winter of 2024. She is immensely proud of the young singers in the
      Junior Singers ensembles as they have come together in friendship and fun
      to create beautiful music together. As the Administrative Director for the
      ensemble, Chelsea looks forward to connecting with new and returning
      singers and families to support a positive experience for all!
