    <p>
      Music brings the stories we tell to life! And so many of the movies we
      have loved are animated by the music of orchestras and choirs. We’ve
      picked some of the greats, and hope you’ll join us in celebrating the
      music of modern story telling! Featuring both original selections from
      films such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, and well-loved
      classical pieces from major films including Orff's “O Fortuna” and
      Mozart's “Requiem”, we invite you to experience music from timeless tales
      and bask in the stories we all love to tell and retell. Bring your family
      and your imagination, and relive some great movie moments with us!
