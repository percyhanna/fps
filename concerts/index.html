      We are very pleased to present our very first performance of our Foothills
      Youth String Orchestra, featuring an exciting blend of classical, pop and
      movie music! The beginner ensemble will kick off the concert with a
      beautiful rendition of Holst’s “Jupiter” from The Planets, a lively and
      engaging performance of “Drunken Sailor” that is sure to get the
      audience's feet tapping, as well as a wonderful energetic and gritty piece
      titled “Pirates of Aegan” and more.

      The Intermediates have diligently prepared Vivaldi’s “Concerto for Strings
      in D major, RV121” which will highlight the precision and musicianship of
      our young musicians as they perform its intricate melodies and beautiful
      harmonies. Showcasing their versatility next, they will switch gears into
      some pop music, followed by movie music including Top Gun, and Mission
      Impossible, and much more!
