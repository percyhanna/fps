      The Ladies Vocal Jazz originated as an idea two members of the Chorus who
      wanted to explore the Ladies Vocal Jazz tradition. After a wonderfully
      successful trial in the Summer of 2016, their first official season
      started in the fall of 2016, with their first concert being December of
      2016, performing to a near sold-out show!

      Since then, the Ladies Vocal Jazz has continued to grow, adding a Ladies
      Vocal Jazz due to the high interest, as well as a smaller group doing more
      difficult repertoire. The Ladies Vocal Jazz has since settled into a
      16-member format, selected by audition, and have performed with local
      schools, events such as the Harvest of Hope, with the Foothills
      Philharmonic Chorus, and the AHSFA Vocal Ensemble.

      Their concerts regularly include solo acts from within the group, as well
      as being occasionally accompanied by a guest Jazz combo. They are excited
      for what the future will bring!
