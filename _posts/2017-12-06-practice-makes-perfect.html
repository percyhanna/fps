      It is commonly held that Malcolm Gladwell wrote, in his book, “Outliers,
      the story of success” that it takes 10,000 hours of practise in a field to
      become an expert. This is one of the misinterpretations I most enjoy - it
      just isn’t his case, and is only half the story.
      <!--more-->
      Gladwell was writing about what it takes to become a phenom; someone who
      is so good that they are identified by only one name. Sports fans think of
      Gretzky, Tiger, Peyton, or Kobe; musicians can think of Heifetz, Menuhin,
      Ashkenazy, or Pavarotti. So, the good news for the rest of us is that we
      don’t’ need to work quite that hard to be experts!

      As children we start sports early, and often are introduced to music early
      as well. The High School football team practises regularly, learns the
      plays, and works through fitness training; while the musician also
      practises regularly, rehearses with the band, choir, or orchestra, and
      works through quantities of technical exercises. In this sense
      participating in sport and music are identical. Each demands discipline,
      training, practise and of course time, to become expert – time that most
      of us don’t have. Both help develop teamwork, leadership, resilience, and
      a willingness to work hard to get things right. All these are skills that
      will help later in life even if you are not a phenom who makes it as a
      professional sportsman or musician.

      Anyway, who needs to be an expert? Being competent, in a group of other
      performers can bring huge satisfaction to the individual and the group.

          So when you attend one of the many musical events available at this
          time of year in the area, remember the work that the performers put
          in, look at their satisfaction at a job well done, and remember that
          you can easily be part of making it happen. If you are interested in
