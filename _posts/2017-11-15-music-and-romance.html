      Ah love! Is there anything better? You’ve cooked a special dinner to show
      your loved one how you feel and lit some candles to set the mood… but
      wait… something’s missing! You push play and the strains of “your song”
      float around the room. That song has always perfectly captured how you
      feel about your beloved.

      Romance would not be the same without a soundtrack behind it. Music’s
      ability to connect and express such intense and passionate feelings make
      music and romance an inseparable pair.

      When it comes to romance and the art of emotions, Opera is the pinnacle.
      Think of our hero, so overcome by love that he bursts into song. In
      Puccini’s Opera La Boheme, the poet Rudolfo, having only briefly met his
      neighbour, Mimi, turns to see her in the moonlight and realizes he has
      fallen in love with her. He sings <em>O soave fanciulla</em> (Oh lovely
      girl) and fortunately for him, Mimi joins him in her profession of love.
    </p>

      Think of our heroine, anguished, about losing her love. In the comic opera
      Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan, young Mabel pleads with her
      love, Fredric, to not rejoin the pirates who raised him, to whom he is
      indentured. She sings the beautiful song <em>Stay, Fredric, Stay!</em> and
      they agree to be faithful to one another until he can return.
    </p>

      When you have this much passion, who even needs words? The Intermezzo from
      Mascagni’s opera Cavalleria Rusticana practically oozes romance with nary
      a word.

          So the next time you are planning a special evening for that special
          someone, take a page out of your favourite composer’s songbook and
          serenade them yourself! (Or, find a really great recording and play
          that!)
