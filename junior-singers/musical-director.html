      Jeff holds a Bachelor of Music degree (with Distinction) from the
      University of Western Ontario, and a Bachelor of Education degree from
      Nipissing University. He is also an alumnus of the Amabile Men's choirs in
      London, Ontario. When he's not singing or teaching, he can often be found
      playing softball, reading with a good cup of coffee, seeking out new music
      to listen to, or going on adventures with his family.

      Conducting the Junior Singers has been a great source of joy for Jeff
      since its inaugural season in 2024. Watching the members of the Junior
      Singers find their voice, challenge themselves, and forge friendships has
      been one of the highlights of his career as an educator. Jeff looks
      forward to another great season with our wonderful singers! (edited)
