      BEGINNER group for young musicians who have just started to learn their
      instruments (up to RCM level 2) and an INTERMEDIATE group for those who

      making beautiful music together, as well as participate in Master Classes,
      sectional and leadership opportunities. We will tackle music from a
      variety of genres, including traditional baroque, popular and movie music,
