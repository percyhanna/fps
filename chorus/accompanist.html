      Amberlyâ€™s passion for music began at a very young age. She sang in both
      children and youth choirs while growing up, in addition to taking piano
      lessons. At age 12 she began playing the organ for her church congregation
      during Sunday worship services, and through High School and University she
      enjoyed playing bassoon and piano in concert and jazz band.

      From 2004-2008 Amberly completed a Bachelor of Music in piano performance
      at the University of Lethbridge. She received excellent training in
      collaborative piano at the hand of Dr. Deanna Oye, which fuelled her
      interest in collaborative and accompanist roles.

      After graduating from University, Amberly began working as a piano
      teacher, accompanist, and free-lance musician. Choral music has always
      been an area of key interest for her, and she has had the opportunity to
      accompany numerous choirs throughout Alberta. In recent years she has
      furthered her musical interests through composing and arranging music, as
      well as learning the cello.

      Amberly and her husband have 4 children. They moved to Okotoks in 2016 and
      have fallen in love with the area. When they are not reading books as a
      family, they enjoy hiking, kayaking, and mountain biking together in the
      beautiful Alberta Foothills and Rockies.
