      Many works are composed specifically for ensembles with smaller numbers,
      while many larger works are adapted for these chamber choruses as well.
      The Foothills Philharmonic Chamber Chorus is an auditioned group that
      loves performing these chamber works, and has gained a reputation for
      performing difficult works of high quality.
