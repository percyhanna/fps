      The FP Vocal Jazz originated as an idea two members of the chorus who
      wanted to explore jazz choral music. After a wonderful successful trial in
      the summer of 2016, their first official season started in the fall 2016,
      with their first concert being fall of 2016 performing to a near sold out
      show.

      Since then it has become Ladies Vocal Jazz, a smaller group selected by
      audition, performing more difficult repertoire. Recent performances
      (outside of their concerts), include Picnic in the Park, and the Okotoks
      Canada Day Celebration.

      They love singing for the seniors homes in the Foothills area for the
      Christmas and Spring seasons, and their concerts are regularly combined
      with the FP Men's Chorus, with a special guest from the Foothills area.

      They are excited to share their music in the coming season, including
      their upcoming Christmas concert, featuring Christmas songs from well
      loved Christmas movies.
